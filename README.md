# TODOS:
- [ ] add new presets  
- [ ] fix documentation `cargo doc --open`
- [ ] make the tests `cargo test`
- [ ] improve logic by maybe using parallel iterators etc...
- [ ] transmit the progress bar to an event handler - if specified
- [ ] run clippy fix for the lib warning `cargo clippy --fix`
- [ ] check for memory allocation (and if there are any improvements)
